::SimpleRest::
by Simon de la Rouviere

SimpleRest is a very basic, lightweight JSON REST server in PHP. The idea of it is to show how a basic REST server functions coming from a knowledge of basic HTML.

Just drop SimpleRest onto (almost) any PHP-enable server and it should work out of the box.

Currently it only consists of 'GET' and 'POST'. These headers are used most often and some hosting companies block any other requests.

Testing it:

Currently, there are no test suites, so testing it involves using curl. Example:

//
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" api.example.com/user/simon
//

The SimpleRest class is adapted from RestUtils. There is a great tutorial at http://www.gen-x-design.com/archives/create-a-rest-api-with-php/.
