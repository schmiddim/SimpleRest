The idea of it is to show how a basic REST server functions coming from a knowledge of basic HTML.\r\n\r\nJust drop SimpleRest onto (almost) any PHP-enable server and it should work out of the box.\r\n\r\nCurrently it only consists of 'GET' and 'POST'. These headers are used most often and some hosting companies block any other requests.\r\n\r\nTesting it:\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are no test suites, so testing it involves using curl. Example:\r\n\r\n//\r\ncurl -i -H \"Accept: application/json\" api.example.com/user/simon\r\n//\r\n\r\nThe SimpleRest class is adapted from RestUtils. There is a great tutorial at http://www.gen-x-design.com/archives/create-a-rest-api-with-php/.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","tagline":"Basic lightweight JSON-based REST server"}
